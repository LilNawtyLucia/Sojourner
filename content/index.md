The Universe Now

_The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin. – Yuri Gargarin_

  
Saved from the fires of an apocalypse, humanity quickly began to search the stars and eventually found lost colonies that had started aboard generational starships long ago. One by one these colonies joined forces with mankind to create a government that was eventually named the United Systems Confederacy. As a government it has little direct power over its citizens though it is effective in maintaining its navy and marine corps.
