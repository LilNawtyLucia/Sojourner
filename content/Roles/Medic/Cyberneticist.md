Sojourner - Medic - Cyberneticist

**Cyberneticist - Base

  

When you become a Cyberneticist at Professional tier, you gain proficiency in Artistry, Engineering, Medical and your choice of Melee or Pistols. You can also install/remove cybernetics and their upgrades to yourself or others at half the cost. You can extract parts to craft cybernetics from the dead, (If they have cybernetics) and you take half the sanity loss. These parts reduce the crafting DC of cybernetics by 20, and can not stack.

  

**Internally Powered - Base

  

To use the full potential of your cybernetics you installed a personal power source into your body. You have 5 power to start and each cybernetic that adds slots for upgrades increases your power by that amount. Power can be replenished through Power Cells between missions. (10 power per cell) 

  

Crafter - Base

  

At Professional tier, you can start spending your Downtime to create Cybernetics in addition to Modules and Upgrades you have available. The Crafting Threshold for an item equals 10 x the item’s Rarity and the cost for each Engineering check is 10% of the item’s base cost.
