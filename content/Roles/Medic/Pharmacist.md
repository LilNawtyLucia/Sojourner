### Combat Stims

At Professional tier, you gain the ability to increase the capabilities of others by injecting them with combat stimulants. These stimulants have varying effects. A character can have no more than three active effects at a time (any more than three and they overdose and die) and the number of combat stims you can apply overall increases as you gain more ranks. At Professional tier, you may apply three combat stims, five at Elite tier and six at Heroic tier. The number of combat stims you can apply refreshes at the end of each day, and each stim lasts for four hours.

|Combat Stim Name|Effects|Lore|Cost to Apply|
|Berserker|While under the effects of this drug you take 2 damage less to health from all sources.|Berserker was initially invented as a combat stimulant to give to Royal Marines under the employ of the Virginian Empire for use when boarding starships and stations. This drug significantly increases aggression in the user as well as their drive to kill; often making them appear 'twitchy' or otherwise unsettling. An individual high on Berserker is often noticed by their twitching facial muscles and heightened rate of breathing. With one puff of this inhalant, almost anyone can become an incredible killing machine even when armed with a basic weapon and minimal armor. Today, this drug is illegal in almost every USC affiliated district.|50 Credits|
|Humming Bird|While under the effects of this drug, burning stamina for additional actions costs you 1 stamina instead of 2.|Hummingbird is legal in some jurisdictions though it is widely viewed as the drug of intellectuals looking to gain an edge. When under its effects and addicted to the drug it is not uncommon for abusers to appear 'jittery' and stay awake for days on end before eventually 'crashing' and sleeping for several days. During these 'crashing' sessions, the brain remains somewhat alert though the user will not experience any actions during this time. Instead, their body will assume a sort of 'automatic pilot' mode which is not readily understood. Individuals in this state can perform various acts and are often seen building things or inventing new machines that make little to no sense during this state. So far, there are no reported cases of an individual in a 'crashed' state acting violently even when attacked directly. This drug is smoked and often rolled into cigarettes or other, legal, consumables in attempts to hide it from authorities.|30 Credits|
|Immunity|When you are reduced to 0hp you remain conscious and can still take actions while under the effect of this drug. You cannot burn stamina for extra actions while in this dying state, however and if you fail a death save you still die. Your death saves regarding damage and your typical death save still apply. If you are stabilized in this state, you are immediately rendered unconscious.|Immunity is an injected drug which is administered directly to arteries rather than veins. It has a strange relationship with authorities who recognize its usefulness as a battlefield medicine though its withdrawal symptoms make the revival and stabilization of injured persons effectively impossible. In most jurisdictions, it is outlawed or extremely heavily regulated. Most users inject this drug into their carotid artery and thus ensure quick delivery to the brain.|50 Credits|
|Jumper|While under the effects of this drug you gain a +2 to your normal movement speed.|Jumper is made from leaves of a Jumpi plant which has been spread throughout the cosmos and grows naturally in most locations across the galaxy even without tending to the plant. It is refined by drying and smoking the leaves for a week or two and adding spices. It comes it many applications though it is normally chewed or smoked. Users tend to be faster than others while on the drug though withdrawals cause individuals to feel enervated and slowed, which they often are. Though Jumper is a legal drug it is considered illegal for sporting events that rely on physical prowess such as sprinting or marathons.|25 Credits|
|Rocky Road|A character under the effects of this drug deals +2 melee damage and has advantage on strength checks.|At one point in time, humanity was restrained by natural restrictions on its limits, created by their brain to avoid over taxing their bodies.  However, by introducing a chemical that induces the same 'hysteric strength' they had told legends of and adding artificial muscle growth hormones, they could manufacture beings of substantial strength.  The downside is the drug is particularly addictive to the brain, as a byproduct is released endorphins and extreme amounts of dopamine. As such when not on the drug addicts feel a plethora of negative emotions, such as rage and sadness. It is typically illegal in most jurisdictions due to violent tendencies in subjects that are regular consumers of the illicit substance.|20 Credits|
