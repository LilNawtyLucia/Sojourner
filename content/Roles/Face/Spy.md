##### **Disruption**

At Professional tier, you can spend an Action attempting to shut down security measures within a 20 Meter radius. You make a Skullduggery check against a nodes DC, and on a success, devices are deactivated for the next 3 Rounds. This Feature does not activate alarms and does not affect Machina or Power Armor.

##### **Stalker**

At Professional tier, you have access to a Tiny drone that can record audio and footage, and can interact with nodes. It uses your modifiers for any checks it has to make. It has a Movement of 8 Meters and deactivates immediately if Attacked. This drone is also concealable on your person.

##### **Ethermore.net**

At Veteran tier, you have access to a secret network of informants. Once per Day, you can make a Persuasion check against the networks DC, and on a success, you can ask available informants three questions which they may or may not be able to answer. At Legendary tier, the network is guaranteed to know the answer to at least one of your questions.

##### **Insurgency**

At Veteran tier, you can conceal any Light Armor and any Rifle you have equipped on your person. You make a Skullduggery check to set the DC for revealing what you conceal, and should you use any tags on your armor other than those that would provide Resistances, the concealment ends immediately.

##### **Skill Expertise**

At Elite tier, you can choose one Skill that is not a Save and increase the modifier cap to 20 for that Skill.
