When you become a Field Commander at Professional tier, you gain proficiency in Melee, Pistols and your choice of two Speechcraft Skills.

##### **Command Actions**

At Professional tier, you have access to a series of Actions that involve aiding your allies through buffs to morale or tactical guidance. These Actions rely on the expense of Command Charges, which you start with two and gain an additional Charge each Rank onward. You can apply your Command Actions to a number of allies equal to how many Charges you choose to expend in an Action, and you regain your Charges during Downtime. Your allies must be able to hear you for your Command Actions to be used and more will become available at later Ranks. You start with the following Commands:

- **Assault the Position**

You can spend an Action and expend a Command Charge to select up to two allies, making them unable to be targeted by the Overwatch Actions of enemies you are aware of.

- **Brothers in Arms**

This Command replaces your Silvered Tongue Feature. You can spend an Action and expend a Command Charge to give an ally a d6 that they can add to any one check of their choice.

- **Push**

When you would hit an enemy with an Attack, you can expend a Command Charge and choose an ally who can Move up to half of their Movement.

- **Strike**

You can spend an Action and expend a Command Charge to have an ally take an Attack Action on your Turn. If they are using a Heavy Weapon, you must expend three Command Charges.

##### **Additional Command Actions**

At Veteran tier, you get access to the following Command Actions:

- **Charge**

You can spend an Action and expend a Command Charge to give an ally +2 to their Reflex checks until the start of their next Turn, but they have to take the Movement Action on their Turn.

- **Mark**

You can spend an Action and expend a Command Charge to choose an enemy and declare them Marked. The Crit range for Attack checks made against this Marked enemy is increased by 1 and these Attacks deal an additional 2 Damage. The Command ends when you choose to end it or until the Marked enemy reaches 0 HP.

- **Rally**

You can spend an Action and expend a Command Charge to give an ally +2 to their Attack checks for their Turn.

##### **Special Equipment**

At Veteran tier, you get access to equipment that only you can use and only cost one Action to use. You have access to the following equipment:

- **Air Cannon**

You can spend an Action to make an Attack check against a target within 50 Meters, throwing them up to 20 Meters away on a successful hit and knocking them Prone. This weapon causes no Damage and cannot be used on targets that are already knocked Prone. This weapon has no Mag capacity and uses your Pistol modifier.

- **Deployable Shield**

You can spend an Action to deploy medium cover that is 2 Meters wide and allows you and your allies to make Ranged Attacks through it. When an enemy would Move through your Deployed Shield, they take 2 Slashing Damage. You have two Shields that you can deploy, and they last for 3 Rounds before they shut off and have to be deployed again. You cannot stack cover.

- **Splinter Pistol**

You can spend an Action to choose up to two targets within 50 Meters, forcing them to make a Fortitude check against a DC equal to 10 + your Observation modifier if their Armor Rating is 10 or below. On a failure, they suffer the Poisoned condition for 3 Rounds.

You can only have one of these options equipped at any given time. You can spend Downtime to swap between your Special Equipment, and you can spend a week of Downtime to remake your Special Equipment should they be lost or destroyed.
