When you become a Smuggler at Professional tier, you gain proficiency in Pistols, Stealth, Skullduggery and your choice of two Speechcraft Skills.

**Climbing suit**

Your movement is unimpeded by climbing and you can climb surfaces that most others would deem impossible to climb. You cannot climb on ceilings, however, unless in zero gravity.

##### **Roguish Menace**

You gain a +2 to your Skullduggery checks for concealing and revealing traps and equipment on individuals.

##### **Smuggling Expertise**

When you make Skullduggery checks and roll below a 10, you can treat the roll as a 10 instead.

**Compression Suit**

At Veteran tier, you may compress yourself to fit into spaces one size smaller than you normally could. When you do so, you are counted as suffocating and lose 2 stamina per turn that you are compressed. If you are a medium sized character, you can use this ability to fit into tiny spaces such as vents.

**Thief’s Intuition**

At Veteran tier, whenever you take damage from a trap, the damage is reduced by half before accounting for any armor resistances.

**Gravity Shift**

Starting at Elite tier, you have gained access to a small, mobile gravity altering device. You may use this device to shift gravity around yourself in any direction you choose on your turn. With this shift in gravity, you may alter its field so that you are considered Flying if you choose to do so and you can never take fall damage from the use of this field even if you would normally take damage from ‘falling’ from that height. You may also use this device to slow your fall as a reaction. You may use this device a number of times equal to your Observation modifier (minimum of 1).
