#### Machinist

In Sojourner, Machinists are one of the major crafting Specialties, supporting their party through the provision of various armor and weapon upgrades. Especially as missions get more difficult, the Machinist is invaluable as they are the only Specialty that can craft most equipment which could mean earlier access to better gear and more ammunition for less Credits. During a mission, a Machinist can be useful as someone with a little bit of Encryption experience or as a quick patch for equipment even in the midst of combat.

When you become a Machinist at Professional tier, you gain proficiency in Artistry, Encryption, Engineering and your choice of Melee or Pistols.
