_"You e'er seen a guy rush an emplaced machinegun without a care in the world all while still shooting back? We call'em Commandoes and they're damned scary. They tend to be highly mobile and tenacious unlike their bigger combatant cousins like the Vanguard. Some folks call'em Lancers too though not sure exactly why. Somethin' about cavalry or some such back in ye olden days. Anyway, you ever see one rushin' your position? You turn and run the other way. The devil himself would turn and run." - Calvary_

  
Combatants who specialize in highly mobile, aggressive warfare are often soldiers who are practiced in similar approaches onto hostile areas. They can quickly dominate in close quarters combat, making them a force to be reckoned with by other types of combatants that prefer to maintain distance. While an Assault may not be the most well versed in melee combat compared to others, their ability to get in close and crank off a number of shots before rapidly getting out of sight or out of range makes them dangerous to anyone... especially on the opposite end of their shotguns.
