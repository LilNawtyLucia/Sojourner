## Combatant

_"Ain't no party like my grandma's tea party... or somethin' like that. Look, espionage is great n' all but ultimately there comes a time when the bullets start flyin' and all that talkin' and hackin' and psion craziness go out the window. I mean think about it... if you're the last man standin' it don't really matter who knows who or what or how right? Anyway, I figure that explains all you need to know about a combatant and what they do. Plain n' simple." - Calvary_

Combatants are perhaps the simplest role in Sojourner and yet a staple of any party. They focus on bringing firepower, maneuverability and overwhelming force into a group. Many groups rely on a Combatant to be their protectors and at times the tip of the spear when combat is their best option over subterfuge. There are many kinds of combatant but ultimately all of them focus on battlefield superiority rather than flashy tricks to win the day.
