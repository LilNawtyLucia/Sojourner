## Appearance

The Dravinauryn are a bipedal race who average around eight feet in height, with the exception being ancestral’s who may stand at about twelve feet in height. Despite their draconian faces, they are mammals that are covered in layers of sharp scales and have soft skin at their undersides and faces. Males have spikey protrusions along their jawlines and have four distinct spikes at the sides of their chins, while females do not. Both genders share long, pointed and unarmored ears as well as spikey crests in place of hair. The species also feature a tail that is slender and sometimes acts as a counterbalance.

## Culture

The Dravinauryn are known to be some of the most iron willed and stubborn people in the galaxy, and likewise their culture has been preserved for hundreds of generations under militaristic ideologies. They were born to two vampiric stars destined to collide and were forced to the void in the hopes of finding a new place to call home: an era known as the Long Drift. Thousands of years amid the stars with only metal keeping their entire race from going extinct has created a people who heavily believe that survival is in unition; stand together or fall together, but never be alone. Additionally, the Dravinauryn are known to be some of the best shipwrights in the universe with their cities spread out through capital classes, guarded by some of the greatest war vessels ever recorded.

Living within every Dravinauryn is a root from a Yggdrae hive; symbiotes which enhance their host’s physical attributes and implant a piece of themselves into children before they are born to pass on symbiosis and allow the hive to expand. Yggdrae hives are recorded to have been massive trees that made up all of the forests on the Dravinauryn homeworld, and are a biomechanical entity which today are infused through the entirety of the ships they are planted in. Yggdrae often describes itself as both one and many identities and is often viewed as having a somewhat motherly instinct towards the Dravinauryn and other people it develops a bond with. In fact, Yggdrae is known to have so strong of a sense of compassion that when people who carry its roots would experience physical suffering before death, it will destroy their nervous system to prevent them from feeling pain and has been known to put people into dream states before they die. Yggdrae is also known for letting people live in alternate realities in their dreams should they be in a coma or cryostasis, so that they aren’t aware of all the time passing by in the real world as well as due to Yggdrae being disturbed by the concept of being alone in a dark, empty void of nothingness.

Memories and history are something that the Dravinauryn have a cultural passion for. Individuals known as Bladesingers specialize in carefully engraving armor, cybernetics or weapons with any mix of visual depictions and writing to describe a common emotion, an event, a memory, a rank, social status or story that greatly impacts the wearer or, in the case of their ships, their crew. Some of the oldest starships in the Eimyrjan Fleet have history and a variety of different stories engraved all over their hulls and weapons, such as the Zahkarien who’s main artillery pieces are wrapped in the story of how the Dravinauryn home system was devoured by fire in memoriam of all the souls abandoned.
