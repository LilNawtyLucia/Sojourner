## Appearance[](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Kheprian?veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Appearance")

Kheprians are an insectoid race who reside in the [Enmir](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Enmir "Enmir") solar system. Although their appearance greatly varies, they often have four arms with the lower two ending in hands while the upper two end in what looks very similar to the arms of a praying mantis, however, these arms can fold into pincers with the upper claw working alongside the lower claw positioned in the elbows. Their bodies are an odd mixture of colorful carapace and visible musculature, and their heads are almost helmet-like in design with armored mandibles that can fold and create the lower portions of this helmet. They have short antennae as well.

## Culture[](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Kheprian?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Culture")

Kheprian culture has a particular focus on respecting nature, specifically the laws of creation. They are a people who have been surrounded by the psionic arts for as long as their history goes, and despite being in a Victorian-like era with the support of much more advanced technology, there is still elements of a much older time that is present. Such as the temples dedicated to each school of psionic energy, which are found at landmarks that are considered mysterious works of Enmir, and monks who walk among even the most modern of the people. Of the upper-class, the majority will still pray and fill their homes with the music of chimes. Alongside a fascination for knowledge their culture is inflated by the belief that they are a gifted people who must live to make their god proud so that they may all see their Heaven someday, and though there is a select few who do not follow so close to these cultural beliefs, overall, the people are often religious in some way.

In the everyday Kheprian's eyes, art is how their Heaven can be depicted or expressed. It can also be how knowledge is shared visually. With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that Kheprian art tends to be very colorful and made as realistic as possible. Sometimes landscapes, no matter how strange they may be, are depicted. Sometimes it's simply abstract, representing a series of emotion the artist often feels. However, this is not passed down to culinary work. Instead, Kheprian dishes, though full of flavor, are never made to be visually appealing. Food is something that has been generously given to the people likely at the expense of a soul that has passed on, and to dress it up would be seen as mockery of that passing soul and as disrespect towards their god; you take what you are given with kindness, and you do not play with it.  

## Religion[](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Kheprian?veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Religion")

### The World Serpent[](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Kheprian?veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: The World Serpent")

Enmir is depicted as a serpent who’s wrapped around Vodira in the infinity formation, with its head positioned in the middle between the two planets and its jaws clamped down onto the end of its own tail, the solar system’s pulsar positioned in place of its singular open eye. Representing an infinite cycle of life, death and renewal, Enmir may also be seen as a symbol of fate as the world serpent decides what may be sacrificed towards future creations and what may not be. This also means that Enmir may be seen as a symbol of both judgement and mercy, as deciding each individual’s fate requires certain action depending on what they’ve done in their lives, and similarly deciding what land and seas may remain and which ones may not.

Temples dedicated to Enmir are often found in unique sites formed by nature, with prayer being silent meditation since it is believed that the wind is Enmir’s breathing and voice. Followers of the World Serpent will always be sure to have any sort of bottles, bowls or other similar objects with their openings down to prevent “capturing Enmir’s breath”, while carefully tuned and crafted chimes will often be strung outside their homes or carried by pilgrims so that Enmir’s voice can be better heard when they are away from these sites. Followers of Enmir who have died will be buried within these sites so that they may feed the World Serpent and hopefully see their Heaven within its stomach. To be cremated is often seen as having your chance to be in Heaven taken away from you, because you are not providing towards the cycle of existence.

Assuming that Enmir decided you to have a good ending to your existence, there is no one depiction of Heaven because what your Heaven looks like is based on what you imagine it to. As a loyal follower and listener, it is believed that you will be guided through the fog of Enmir’s Jaws by knowing its voice, and you will be shown your Heaven as a gift back to you for your sacrifice. However, if Enmir has decided to give you a bad ending to your existence, you are sworn to forever wander in the fog of its Jaws, alone and without any sense of direction. Individuals who have committed terrible crimes may be banished to Enmir’s Jaws because of this belief, as the souls of the damned may be the only souls you’ll ever see and the only echo you’ll ever hear is your own.

### The Vanimae[](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Kheprian?veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: The Vanimae")

It is believed that those who possess psionic capabilities are souls that have been permitted to leave Enmir’s stomach to act as the World Serpent’s vessels in the physical realm. These gifted people are known as the Vanimae. Not every Vanimae is sworn a complex task, nor is every Vanimae sworn a good task. Some of these individuals may be guardians of sacred sites dedicated to Enmir. Some of these individuals may be guides to aid those who’ve gotten lost in the fog of Enmir’s Jaws back to the physical realm, if they are deemed innocent. Some of these individuals may be executioners who are employed to deliver Enmir’s judgement or to continue the cycle of existence, much like the grim reaper.

At every sacred site, there is an elder Vanimae and a trial they can hold for gifted individuals. These courses are designed to prove that these gifted individuals are Vanimae, and to help them in discovering what their task as a Vanimae is. Not every gifted individual may pass these trials, and these people are known as Wisps; people who may have inherited a piece of a proper Vanimae. A Wisp may then become a caretaker for these sacred sites, lesser warriors and so on.

### Enmir’s Children[](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Kheprian?veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Enmir’s Children")

When strangers are caught in Enmir’s Eye and crash onto Vodira, they are known as the Children of Enmir, for they did not come from the World Serpent’s stomach but rather from the void beyond the Serpent itself. Though these individuals are special, they do not outrank Vanimae and many people, both followers of Enmir and not, are often suspicious of these strangers. They are still welcome within the sacred sites, provided they have not shown themselves to be hostile, and may still join the people in prayer if they so choose.
