## Appearance

Machina are bipedal robots. They are not born but are constructed in massive factories on demand by those who wish to be 'parents' in their society. There is little variation between units of the same model though different model types can vary wildly in appearance. Most Machina look similar to humans in regard to overall construction; two legs, two arms, a head, a torso and similar facial construction. Often, however, they are wider and of a stockier build than is typical for humanity.

## Culture

Logic is everything in Machina society though when they immigrate to other societies they tend to adapt and adopt new moral codes rather quickly. Most Machina that immigrate do so to explore and experience other cultures. Many do not understand how organics have thrived despite many decisions being made in error or when decisions are made emotionally. A handful, relative to the size of the species, are capable of understanding emotion though all of them are capable of experiencing it.

Life begins at manufacturing. The newly manufactured Machina is programmed with the memories of language, general customs and that which is necessary to their introduction into society. From there, they are sent to meet their 'parents' who have downloaded a personality matrix into the new Machina which is made from a combination of their own matrices at random. Matrices that would have caused catastrophic failures due to coding errors are automatically aborted before they are downloaded. Often, Machina parents download dozens of matrices at a time in order to ensure that at least one of their 'offspring' will be successful.

After meeting their assigned family unit, the Machina begins its new life immediately and joins the ranks of others in a profession that it chooses. For this purpose, newly minted Machina are not specialized. Instead, when they choose a profession, they are then modified to fit that profession's minimum requirements and tolerances. Any additional modifications are done by that Machina themselves using the money earned from working their job.

Energy is provided freely in Machina culture to ensure that no Machina in their society ever perishes due to a lack of available electricity. However, there is little leisure time in their society as well and Machina regularly work one hundred sixty hours a week with only eight hours of downtime; four of which must be dedicated to maintenance of their own chassis. Some Machina take to becoming explorers for this purpose. Outdated Machina which no longer serve a purpose are often broken down for scrap parts; a process that effectively kills them. Other Machina take to becoming mercenaries as a result of this though those that don't do go to be recycled willingly.
