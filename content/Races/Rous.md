## Appearance[](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Rous?veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Appearance")

Rous are a species of humanoid rodent, often having white to gray fur coats and black accents. They have pointed pink noses, round leathery ears and a long, whip-like naked tail that is prehensile. Their hands are pink and without fur, as are their feet. Another unique feature that the Rous have is a lack of lower ribs, making the access of tight spaces much easier.

## Culture[](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Rous?veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Culture")

While the origins of where the Rous come from is unknown, they have claimed Junkyard as their new home… as well as any ships they manage to infest. With a tendency to steal and having unsurprisingly short tempers, the Rous are best known as being the gremlins of the universe with an all-too-well grasp on how advanced technologies function. In fact, a fascination for “the great shiny things” is how they have managed to survive in the caustic environment of Junkyard. After some Rous escaped beneath the Scrin’s thumb, it’s believed that they came to inhabit Junkyard after the ships they infested were dumped there and their knack for engineering was developed from repurposing functional ships into nests. The focus on engineering for their own survival has even led the species to be a technocracy, as well as an absolute menace should they infest any ships out in the void.

Both crafty and masters of guerrilla tactics, many Scrin have grown to fear Rous and refuse to even dare step foot onto Junkyard. Others may even go as far as to gas or torch out the ventilation systems of their ships should they even *suspect* a Rous infestation. Meanwhile, they are most often viewed as an annoyance to other races with only a few reports of positive relationships being formed between Rous and the occupants of whatever ship they’ve come to call a new home. One race the Rous have a particular interest in hiding with is the Dravinauryn, who after many years of tolerating the infestations they couldn’t get rid of, have in some cases employed Rous as tiny engineers for systems they can’t access themselves so easily. This has led some Rous to become much more educated and resistant towards a common virus on Junkyard called Apoplexia Verminosa, or Vermin Stroke, which targets Rous specifically.
