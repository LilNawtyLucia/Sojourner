## Appearance

Humans have two arms, legs and a head and torso. They are not covered in fur or scales like most other races and have a generally soft skin on most of their bodies. They stand upright and are generally not particularly noteworthy in terms of overall strength, endurance or their capability to survive hits. Unlike most races, however, they are extremely social even compared to other pack-oriented species like Anubians.  

## Culture

A massive variety of cultures exist within the human domains. Some of them are warlike, some are very docile. What binds the human culture, overall, together is the capacity for understanding even between radically different cultures. At times, it sparks conflagration and war and strife, but humanity has a knack for uniting against common enemies and bringing the full might of their wrath upon them. Likewise, humans are capable of great compassion that on a galactic scale seems lacking in other species. While most would have left a medieval species to die as 'too much effort to save', humanity took the responsibility of saving the race of [Anubians](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Anubian "Anubian") from certain destruction when their star was about to go supernova. While it created yet more strife to teach a species to adapt from a medieval way of thinking to a modern era of technology, culture and methodology, humanity were the ones to take them in.

Other examples of humanity's capacity for acts that are inherently regarded as uncivilized by other races include the nuclear bombardment of their own worlds such as Smali when it rebelled against the Virginian Empire that caused devastation on a scale unprecedented and sent the entirety of the world into a dark age for over a decade. Biological weapons meant to induce suffering and cause mayhem exist within the human stockpiles and though tailor made to specific races or specific genomes are generally considered brutish and even evil by other races.

Yet despite this, humanitarian aid to those that need it most is often sent by humanity even when it would cost the citizens giving that aid dearly. When a world is burned by another race and its people starving and alone, it is most commonly humanity that rushes to send ships full of food, evacuation efforts and medical aid to their planets. Natural disasters are met with money to fix and rebuild infrastructure, volunteers to bring about the repairs faster and soldiers and mercenaries to keep the peace during those efforts.

It is widely accepted that humans will, during times of war, fight harder, longer and that planets will break before their resolve does. Offensive wars against humanity that managed to get past the military were often met with civilians holding weapons behind every tree, some of them even throwing their lives down with mere pitchforks in hand against enemies in power armor, and even immolate themselves with vests full of explosives to turn the tide of a battle. When raw military might fails many species opt to attempt to bring the hearts and minds of the population to heel. Due to the massive variation in humanity's cultures, even living on a single world, they are often able to convince small groups of humans to see their way though it often enrages other groups who then fight more daringly and will even make kamikaze style attacks against heavily fortified locations.

_"You can have no greater enemy than a human. They will fight you in any way they can; throwing sand in your eyes, biting you when you have them restrained, stabbing you in the back or dogpiling onto your friends when they cannot take them alone. Just as often, you can have no greater ally in a fight than a human because they will fight just as hard to defend you from a threat. Yier will be proud." - Unknown Scrin Admiral during the USC-Scrin conflict 2786_

## Religion

Human religion is radically different from sect to sect and some religions have existed since the dawn of their species thousands of years ago. For the sake of brevity, human religions that have developed within the past hundred years will be covered here instead of all of them.

### Notable Religions

#### Children of the Black

The [Children of the Black](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Children_of_the_Black "Children of the Black") come from many different backgrounds and ethnicities. What binds them together is their common belief that space is humanity's birthright and final journey in the holy path set before them by their God. They believe that all life was created as a cosmic entity to wander the stars. Races which have not yet achieved spaceflight are simply not yet enlightened and it is the will of space itself that will be their salvation or damnation. Most Children of the Black are citizens of Spacer groups and the largest group of these individuals exists in the [Ark Fleet](https://sojourner-into-the-wasteland.fandom.com/wiki/Ark_Fleet_(Spacers) "Ark Fleet (Spacers)").
