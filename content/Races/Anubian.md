## Appearance

Anubians resemble humanoid jackals and have a surprising resemblance to humanity in terms of their general body shape and appearance. Like humans, they have four fingers and a thumb though they are sometimes tipped in vicious claws that can be quite formidable even against armored opponents. Their feet are digitigrade which makes finding proper shoes difficult in other sections of civilized space and the shape of their legs is somewhat awkward compared to humanity's. Nevertheless, Anubians share many other characteristics with humanity, making them one of the most unlikely examples of convergent evolution in the galaxy.

## Culture

Anubian culture was drastically changed when humanity arrived at their world. Finding the solar system on the verge of impending doom, as a result of their star nearing collapse, a massive evacuation effort was required on a scale previously unparalleled. Thousands of ships including military owned vessels and privately owned starships as well as even some corporate vessels flocked to their homeworld and landed while translators worked around the clock to decipher their language. In the end, it was a relatively small handful that were able to leave with most of them being younger generations rather than older ones. It took a lot of experimentation to figure out how to care for Anubians though thankfully their dietary needs were not dissimilar from humanity's own. The two generally coexist in many star systems without much need for habitat changes or for supplements to diet.

  
Most of Anubian culture is drawn from distant memories of their homeworld and most cultural anthropologists agree that their culture is going to be unrecognizable within the span of a decade or two. What is likely to remain is the concept of clans and the values of family among their species which were engrained into many of the youngest in their early days of life. Anubians have a strong pack mentality which rivals that of humanity's own social patterns. Clans are made up of families with the oldest male and female, who are not necessarily related, leading the family (or 'pack') of Anubians. These elders make decisions on marriage, property disputes and much more, functioning similarly to judges or monarchs.

  
Even in the modern world, strength and perseverance are highly valued in Anubian culture. They are taught early in life that in order for their family to function best that they must be as strong as they can be since 'the weakest link of the chain is the weakest link of us all'. Many younger Anubians enlist into the Marine Corps of their various worlds or the Navy as a result not only to strengthen themselves in the literal sense but also to strengthen themselves mentally and see more of the galaxy to become wiser than they were. Anubians also tend to be fairly militaristic and believe that a strong military or similar fighting force is the way that the USC maintains its independence.

### Premodern History

Before the USC arrived at their world the Anubians were still a fragmented species that fought with one another. Most of their people lived in small, tight-knit and xenophobic communities that were nomadic though other civilizations had begun to spring up around the planet. Some areas were undergoing a massive technological advancement that saw the advent of early firearms like muskets arising in armies while the mostly nomadic individuals were primarily still using primitive spears and shields made from animal hides.

#### The Nomads

For those living nomadic lifestyles, trade and war were almost intwined into a singular profession and gave rise to the Mitter (loosely translated to 'Samurai'). The nomadic tribes were far from savage and most were rather technologically capable for their time period. They crafted special weapons and armor for the Mitter made from carbon steel and spring steel; often spending vast sums on the protection and armament of these warriors that would lead them into battle. Many times, a tribe's chieftain was also the tribe's Mitter of which a tribe usually only had one save for the Mitter's apprentices.

##### Mitters

Mitter were more than simple warriors with good equipment. Though their titles were not hereditary by technicality, it was most often the children of Mitters that became Mitters since their parents were usually rich and could afford the expensive training, weapons and armor to make them into a Mitter. Becoming a Mitter happened by challenging the Mitter of a tribe (which did not have to be that Anubian's tribe) and winning against them in single combat. By the laws of most tribes, this did not have to end in death though it usually did since medical technology was rather poor for the time period. Such challenges were fairly rare due to the disparity between a nomad's typical training (which usually involved gathering food, hunting and trapping rather than fighting) and a Mitter's. If an Anubian became the Mitter of another tribe that they did not belong to, that Anubian either left their own tribe and became a part of the other or both tribes, provided that their relationships were not terrible, would join together.

Females were specifically forbidden from participating in war as were the elderly though child soldiers in the nomadic tribes were fairly common and expected around the age of ten. Captured Anubian women were supposed to be treated as humanely as possible and even given positions within the tribe that captured them though most often were sold into sexual slavery, forced into marriage to a Mitter or Chieftain or became a concubine for the same.

Of particular note, however, is Mitterin Adama Kamuni who was the only female Mitter in the recorded history of the Anubian race before their uplifting into modern spacefaring society. Mitterin Kamuni went against tradition when her tribe was on the verge of being wiped out by hostile actions from other tribes and stole the armor of her sick, wounded father along with his sword. Before this, Mitterin Kamuni had no record of any training in secret or otherwise though it is unlikely that she was not trained at all. She engaged other nomadic tribes in a warpath that left half the tribes on her continent devastated with losses and those that would not submit to her rule diplomatically after the death of her father (who had later died of his injuries) were instead forced to surrender by her blade. Often times, in history, she is said to have led charges herself, specifically put herself in positions that no one else in her tribe desired to be in during assaults and had even begun assaulting some of the various cities. Mitterin Kamuni was among the Anubians that were uplifted and became a mercenary though her fate is unknown.

#### Societal Norms

Women in nomadic tribes were expected to be protected, cared and provided for by their male counterparts. Most often, women that were unmarried took up professions as entertainers, seamstresses or as Mitteresses who tended to wounded or exhausted Mitters if they were wealthy and educated. Strictly forbidden from fighting, a woman could be ordered to take her own life in most tribes if she ever took up a weapon for the purpose of doing so or struck anyone.

Traditionally, women wore a garb called a Toya which is similar to a kimono though far more open in the chest while still remaining modest. Such garments are generally very colorful, tight in the waist and hips though loose in the legs to allow for mobility. These garments are not worn by most Anubian women in the modern era save for special occassions such as funerals, weddings and similar functions. Women that wore men's garments outside of the home were largely considered to be religiously unclean though how strictly this was followed remains a subject of debate even among Anubian elders.

Anubians in the past forbade their women from speaking to men unless spoken to or for the purposes of business if they were of the same age. Elders were the exception to this rule as well as children who could be approached readily. Many tribes even made separate areas entirely for the unmarried women of the tribe which was visited by men seeking marriage. Transportation of goods between this location and the main area of the tribe was done by a married woman or sometimes multiple.

#### City Life

The cities had few standing armies and most 'militaries' were comprised entirely of volunteers looking to earn fortune and fame through military service. These individuals were often poorly trained, especially compared to Mitters, and relied on their superior firepower and the city's walls to endure an attack from nomads. Most individuals inside a city were typically tradesmen or performed such duties as mining rather than endure military service.

Nevertheless, with regard to trade, many of the cities were meant for just that. Some cities even became so popular hotspots for trading that nomads made a silent agreement with one another not to attack each other within the city walls as well as to never siege those cities for fear of how it may disrupt trade. No official agreements were ever made though those cities tended to provide incentives for nomads to keep and honor this arrangement such as opening guild halls for individual tribes where they could rest and recouperate unimpeded by the dangers of living on the move constantly. Cities with these guild halls were often among the richest in the world while they still functioned.

#### Arlekin

The civilized Anubians of the time had Arlekins (no translation available) in direct response to Mitters. Though a Mitter would win against an Arlekin in single combat quite often, Arlekins were far more numerous and quite often capable of attacking from a distance whereas Mitters relied primarily on their swords. An Arlekin was lightly armored and paired with a Kline (the Anubian version of a horse) and equipped with a lance and a crossbow though sometimes firearms. While any of these weapons could potentially get through a Mitter's armor, it took extreme careful aim and precision to actually accomplish, especially from a distance.

Arlekins were the elite warrior caste of the cities and often held titles that marked them above other warriors and peasants which leads experts in the modern era to believe that they were the precursors to a rise of a feudalistic society in Anubian culture. They were, like Mitters, educated though unlike Mitters their education mostly consisted of commanding a battlefield and the necessary logistical understanding to supply troops far away from their local territories. Arlekins fought to gain territory, to secure the use of resources and at times to force a surrender between themselves and a Mitter leading a war band. Sometimes, if the city was wealthy enough, Arlekins would even train alongside Mitters and learn their ways of combat to become something more.

#### Societal Norms

Anubian men could and were drafted into service by the various guilds that existed within their society though it was exceptionally rare and usually required specific circumstances. Guilds were mostly held up to their own laws by their populace though Mitters would arbitrate said laws in the event of a dispute as a neutral party. Often times such Mitters would be accompanied by Arlekins and a local militia of the population to ensure that no one tried to make a quick power grab during negotiations. Poisoning in the guild leaders was fairly common which led to a culture that found offering food and drink during such negotiations to be uncouth and even considered a threat in some circumstances.

Conversely to tribal societies of the times, women were given the rights to own property under most guilds and were often the ones seeking out men to marry rather than the other way around. Maternity leave was not expected for any Anubian woman though granted to those who had exceptionally difficult labors. They were still not permitted to join military roles, especially combative roles, though they were allowed to join any other profession of their choosing. Some of them even owned businesses though it was considered to be exceptionally rare and most businesses were still passed through inheritance to the eldest male child of the family to make them a more attractive prospect for marriage.

### Religion

The religion of Anubians can be difficult for outsiders to follow without a lengthy introduction period to its innerworkings. They are a polytheistic culture though many Anubians have adopted human religions instead in their search for wisdom. Few humans adopt Anubian religion, just as few of any other race do, though it is not so rare as to be unheard of. The Anubian religion can be summarily explained that their primarily deity is Bilther who carries the galaxy on his back (previously the World, referring to their homeworld, before Anubians were uplifted by humanity).

  
Bilther takes the form of a creature similar to a wolf and was the origin of the universe which he carries on his back through its cosmic journey. Any sustenance granted to an Anubian of this faith is a direct result of Bilther consuming cosmic beings for his own energy and the scraps of which fall to his back where they take the form of plants and animals. Through the Anubian's holy texts, Bilther commands Anubians never to waste anything, food or otherwise, as doing so is wasting that which he has given to them and refusing his gifts of life. Other commandments from Bilther include never to consume the flesh of fallen pack members though cannibalism of non-pack members is not strictly forbidden (though still taboo in culture). Most other commandments are similar to the religions of others, especially Abrahamic religions, though it is unclear if these commandments were made as a result of accidental cultural contamination or if they existed previously in Anubian culture.

  
Guldir, the Anubian goddess of the underworld and afterlife, looks like an Anubian's skeleton wearing little clothing. She is the taker of Anubian souls to Bilther's mouth where they are consumed and held within him to become a part of him once again. Consumption of the soul is not, by culture, painful or a terrifying event. Instead, it is said to be a joyous reunion with members of family and friends. After being consumed, the Anubian's soul is eventually reincarnated into a new creature though it does not necessarily entail reincarnation as a new Anubian. Anubians could be reincarnated as animals, plants or even another sapient race. Fringe elements of Anubian culture refute that Anubians would be born into a new race and instead refer to these species as 'soulless in the eyes of Bilther'.

  
Otix, goddess of love and harmony, is Bilther's companion in the great cosmic voyage and is speculated to be another galaxy. Though she is far from Bilther in location, Anubians believe that she is near by the bond that they share. Otix is said to have brought the Anubians the same pack bond that Otix shares with her lover so that they could be made less savage and have something to cherish and hold dear to them. Such relationships, gifts of Otix, do not inherently command romantic entanglement. Instead, the bonds formed between an Anubian and a pet, friend, lover or even a family member are all Otix's blessings.

### Naming Conventions

Traditional Anubian names have a single syllable word in Anubian which represents their tribe or city that they are from. In the modern day, this meaning was changed to denote familial ties though some very old Anubians still have their city's syllable in their name. These syllables are often attributed to the non-Anubian parents that adopt Anubian children as well, leading to some names that have multiple cultural origins. Some examples of these syllables are Kel, Jur, Om, Vid and Lur. This syllable is followed by the Anubian's first name. A few examples of traditional Anubian names are listed below.
